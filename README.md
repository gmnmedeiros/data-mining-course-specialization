# data-mining-course-specialization
Machine Learning algorithms developed throughout my Data Mining specialization course.

Each of the files contains a problem I faced, which I had to solve using specific algorithms.

Throughout eight weeks we studied algorithms such as SVM, Decision Trees, Kmeans Clustering, DBA, Logistic Regression, Knn, etc.
